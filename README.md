This folder is a subset of the code behind the paper "Using Satellite Data to
Fill the Gaps in the US Air Pollution Monitoring Network" by Daniel M. Sullivan
and Alan Krupnick. It is designed to be run using the script `driver.sh` but
the top-level Python scripts can be run individually.

Python files in the `analysis`, `clean`, and `util` folders are all auxiliary
files. They are imported by the top-level scripts but not meant to be invoked
directly from the command line. Organization is outlined
[here](http://www.danielmsullivan.com/pages/tutorial_workflow_2project_org.html#full-empirical-project).
